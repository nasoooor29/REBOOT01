# Net-Cat

## Description

This project is a recreation of the NetCat (nc) command-line utility in a
Server-Client architecture.

NetCat (nc) is a versatile networking tool that reads and writes data
across network connections using TCP or UDP. This implementation focuses
on TCP connections, enabling features like opening TCP connections, listening
on arbitrary TCP ports, and facilitating a group chat.

## Features

- TCP connection between server and multiple clients (1 to many).
- Maximum number of simultaneous connections to 10.
- Message Broadcast: Clients can send messages to the chat.
- Message Filtering: Do not broadcast empty messages.
- Message Format: Messages are timestamped and include the sender's name.
  `[YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS][client.name]: [client.message]`
- Message History: New clients receive all previous messages upon joining.
- Join/Leave Notifications: Clients are informed when others join or leave.
- Continuous Operation: Clients leaving do not disrupt the connection for others.
- This project utilizes go-routines and mutexes to handle concurrent client
  connections and ensure thread-safe access to shared resources.

## Build

In a terminal navigate to the root of the project directory & run the below
command to build the binary.

```bash
make build
```

If for any reason you do not have the make binary installed on your operating
system, you can directly run the below command to compile the binary.

```bash
go build -o bin/TCPChat
```

## Usage

```bash
cd bin/
./TCPChat <port>
```

If no port is specified, the server will be running on the default port of **8989**.

To test the connection, launch another terminal on the host machine or another
device and run the below command:

```bash
nc <ipaddress> <port>
```
